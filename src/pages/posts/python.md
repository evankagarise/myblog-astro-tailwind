I’ve chosen a countertop from IKEA called [KARLBY](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/karlby-worktop-walnut-veneer-00335201/). It’s affordable even including a shipping cost in Japan. This countertop 184cm long which gives me plenty of room to scatter my stuff. It’s also big enough for my wife and I to sit side by side.
